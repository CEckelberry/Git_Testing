What git command creates a branch?
git branch -b <branch name here>

What is the difference between a fast-forward and recursive merge?
Fast forward merge is where all files merge just fine as git can put the commits on top of the merging branch chronologically. Recursive is a non-chronological order merge. 

What git command changes to another branch?
git checkout <branch name here>

What git command deletes a branch?
git branch -d <branch name here>

How do merge conflicts happen?
When changes are made on the same files in two separate branches and then those branches are being merged back into the same "master" branch, you have to choose
which changes to keep and which changes to drop between the same change files.
